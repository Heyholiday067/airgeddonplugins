<strong>Description</strong>

<ul>
    <li><strong>avoid_airmon.sh:</strong> This plugin disables airmon-ng to be used to start and stop monitor mode on an interface. <code>iw</code>will be used instead.</li>
    <li><strong>multint.sh:</strong> This plugin enables Airgeddon to use more than one interface to be used with Captive Portal attack. By default, Airgeddon uses <code>Virtual Interface</code> method on supported chipsets to create  monitor mode and master mode required to run captive portal attack. For users who do not have a fully compatible chipset, they can use this plugin to use multiple cards that support monitor and master mode one per card to run captive portal attack.</li>
